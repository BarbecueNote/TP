# Project ReadMe

This project contains three main files:

- `main_basic.rs`: This file contains the Rust code for the basic version of the code after translation.
- `main2.rs`: This file contains the intermediate code.
- `main_conc.rs`: This file contains the concurrent version of the code using threads.

Feel free to explore each file to understand the different versions of the code.
